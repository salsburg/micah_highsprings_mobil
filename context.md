## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Understanding the Data Sources

### Daily Book vs. True P&L
The Q3 data comes from **Daily Book/POS software** (SSCS) - this is **NOT** a true accounting P&L statement.

**Daily Book "Current Net Profit" ≠ Real Accounting Profit**

Daily Book includes:
- ✅ Fuel margin (BUT fuel cost shows $0.00 - data error/misconfiguration)
- ✅ Merchandise margin
- ✅ Lottery commissions
- ✅ Some paid-outs

Daily Book does NOT subtract:
- ❌ Rent ($72,000/year)
- ❌ Full payroll
- ❌ Insurance
- ❌ Utilities
- ❌ Credit card processing fees
- ❌ Property taxes
- ❌ Franchise fees
- ❌ Maintenance
- ❌ Accounting/legal fees
- ❌ Shrinkage

**Daily Book is useful for**: Fuel gallons, merchandise tracking, shrink analysis, lotto payouts
**Daily Book is NOT useful for**: Profitability, valuation, cash flow, EBITDA

## ⚠️ CORRECTED ANALYSIS: The "Discrepancy" Explained

**The original 22x "discrepancy" was a misinterpretation of two different accounting systems.**

### What We Now Know:
1. **Q3 Daily Book $594k "profit"** = Gross margin minus limited paid-outs (NOT real profit)
2. **Seller's $107k projection** = Likely closer to true accounting profit (but still unverified)

### The Real Problem:
We are comparing:
- **Daily Book** (operational POS data, missing most expenses)
- **Seller's P&L** (accounting projection, possibly manipulated)

**Neither can be trusted for valuation without verification.**

---

## Critical Due Diligence Required

### Must Obtain Immediately:

**1. Tax Returns & Financial Statements (2023, 2024, 2025 YTD)**
- Schedule C (or Form 1120 if incorporated)
- Complete P&L statements
- Balance sheets
- Sales tax filings

**2. Fuel Supplier Documentation**
- Fuel supplier contracts (rack pricing, freight, fees)
- Monthly fuel supplier statements (showing actual cost, volumes, credit card pass-throughs)
- Branded fuel requirements & penalties
- Rebate agreements

**3. Credit Card Processing Statements**
- Merchant processing statements (blended rates, fuel pump vs in-store)
- EBT processing fees
- True all-in card processing costs

**4. Lottery Commission Statements**
- Actual lottery commissions paid
- Scratcher payout reconciliation
- Daily Book often misreports lottery net

**5. Lease Agreement / Property Ownership**
- Is this a lease or purchase?
- Lease terms, renewal options, escalations
- Who owns the underground storage tanks?
- Environmental liabilities?

**6. Payroll Records**
- ADP/Paychex statements showing actual wages paid
- Worker's comp insurance
- Payroll tax filings

**7. Operating Expenses Documentation**
- Utility bills (12 months)
- Insurance policies & premiums
- Maintenance invoices
- Franchise fee calculations
- Property tax bills

## Revised Investment Assessment

### If Seller's $107k Projection is Accurate:
- Purchase Price: $300,000
- Annual Net Profit: $107,737
- **ROI: 35.9% annually**
- **Payback Period: 2.8 years**
- **This would be an excellent deal**

### Reality Check Questions:
1. **Why is the seller leaving money on the table?** If it truly nets $107k/year with minimal owner involvement, why sell for only $300k?

2. **What's the real owner involvement?** Is this passive or does it require 60+ hours/week?

3. **What major expenses are hidden?**
   - Deferred maintenance?
   - Upcoming environmental compliance?
   - Tank upgrades required?
   - Franchise renewal fees?

4. **What are the real fuel margins?** The Daily Book shows 100% margin (impossible). What are actual CPG margins after:
   - Rack price
   - Freight
   - Credit card fees
   - Branded fuel fees

5. **Is the business deteriorating?**
   - Compare 2023 vs 2024 vs 2025 tax returns
   - Is traffic declining?
   - New competition?

## Bottom Line

**Status**: Insufficient data to evaluate

**Seller's $107k projection**: Plausible but unverified

**Q3 Daily Book data**: Operationally useful but financially meaningless for valuation

**Next Step**: Request complete tax returns (2023-2025) and fuel supplier statements

**Risk Level**: High until verified with tax returns

**Opportunity**: Could be excellent at $300k purchase price - IF the $107k profit is real and sustainable
